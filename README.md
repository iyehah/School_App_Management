### Why These Files Are Imported:

1. Students:
   - Purpose: The students module typically manages student data. This could include storing information like names, grades, attendance, and any other relevant details.
   - Why Import?: If the app needs to display student information, process student-related activities (like enrollment or grading), or interact with student records, this module would need to be imported to access and manipulate that data.

2. Teachers:
   - Purpose: The teachers module handles data related to the teaching staff. This includes managing their personal information, schedules, and classes they teach.
   - Why Import?: When the app needs to assign teachers to classrooms, manage their schedules, or provide them with student data, the teachers module must be imported.

3. Classrooms:
   - Purpose: The classrooms module might deal with the physical or virtual spaces where teaching takes place. It could store data on room availability, size, equipment, or even virtual classroom links.
   - Why Import?: This module is essential for managing the assignment of students and teachers to specific classrooms, scheduling classes, or organizing class-related activities.

4. Database:
   - Purpose: The database module is crucial for storing and retrieving all the data managed by the other modules. It acts as the backbone of the application, holding all the records related to students, teachers, classrooms, and more.
   - Why Import?: Any operation that involves saving, updating, deleting, or retrieving data from the app will require interaction with the database. Therefore, it is imported to provide access to the database functionality across the app.

### Comment Explanation
In your Git project, importing these files or modules is essential because they each represent a core part of the application's functionality. The app needs to interact with students, teachers, classrooms, and the underlying database to function correctly. Each import allows different parts of the application to access and use the necessary data and operations related to these entities.
